        ================Start Routine=====================-
        Electric Master Switch On (depress "}")-
        Get the external Air compressor resources
        Then simulates the action of a pneumatic starter.-
        KEEP the "s" key hold down until the engine is running
        The engine will spin up to % 30 N1
       AND wait for the Pressure Ratio  instrument to indicate 1.08
       The Engine has started , release the "s" key.

        -==============Take Off ==on Runway or carrier===========
	    The wings fold must be DOWN  => key "f"
	    The wings incidences must be UP  => key (toggle) " ="
        your anounciator "WING WHEELS DROOP"  must be light off
	    The canopy must be closed/locked  => key (toggle) "d"
	    Don't forget  to disengage the NWS => key"n"
	    
	  -=================================================  
	  
	  the key sequence  } = s d f n  can do everything you want 
	  then just disengage the brake-parking and push throttle

        -============On Any Carrier================-
        ======Take Off
        -Maintain the "L" key depressed the time to activate the launbar (5 seconds)-
        -You can see that operation with the external view-
        -Don't forget to prepare your Aircraft
        with ==Start Routine== and with ==Take Off ==on Runway or Carrier==
        -Then depress the "C" key  to launch
        your stick is being locked  remain on neutral position during catapulting.
        ======Landing
        -Your approach  is between 100 and 110 Knts ( you can help yourself with the AoA indicator)

        -The Hook must be down key "O"
        -The Aircraft must be prepared with wings incidences UP and gears DOWN
        -The Hook will operate only if it is in touch on the deck close to the wires center area

        We get the glideslope ~ 3.5 deg   from 3000 ft to sea level
        with:
        - n1 between  64 and 65 % ,
        - pitch trim  between  -0.31 and  -0.29,
        - stick at neutal position ( we guess you are pointing the right heading ).

        =============Wing Incidence=========================
        The wing  is two position incidence, UP or DOWN
        The UP position is being used for approach  landing and take off.
        The UP position has a huge drag. It should  be acted only under 220 knts speed (toggle key =)
        We have included an automatic locking above 260 knts

        =============Consummables========================
        There is two kind of tanks, Main Tank and Transfer Tank
        The Engine is not feeded with the Transfer tank
        The engine will ONLY pump fuel from that Main Tank.
        BEWARE these tanks are not filled up (only half)
        You may full up on ground , see the Menu F-8E.
        If you get the alarm "LOW LEVEL", you can transfer fuel from the Transfer Tank,
        if there is any fuel in the Transfer Tank (look at the capacity tank instruments)
        you can transfer the fuel from Transfer Tank to Main Tank,
        click the "FUEL TRANSFER" switch  on the front Panel (top right)
        Air refueling can be done, if you are in contact with a Tanker
        and if you have previously activated the IFR PROBE
        which is the switch on front Panel (top left)

        During Flight,  REMEMBER, the afterburner  is fuel consummer ,
        you can see the needle of the Main Tank decreasing quickly
        We recommand to look at the the fuel flow instrument which
        indicate the best economical throttle  position.

        =============The Mule=============================
        You may want to experiment the Taxiing with Mule
        To do it:
        1/ You must have Cutoff to True =>   toggle key "{"   if you are Cutoff False
        2/ With "m" key  you will notice a mule in front of the Aircraft
        3/ Key "+" or "-" will operate the force of the Mula
        4/ The usual direction Key, Mouse, Joysyick,  will give the direction of the Mule
