        ================Start Routine=====================-
        Electric Master Switch On (depress "}")-
        Get the external Air compressor resources  ( "s" )-
        The engine will spin up to a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1)-
        This simulates the action of a pneumatic starter.-
        After reaching %15 N2,  Cutoff to False (depress "{")-

        -==============Take Off ==on Runway or carrier===========
        The wings fold must be DOWN  key "f"
        The wings incidences must be UP   key (toggle) " ="
        your anounciator "WING WHEELS DROOP"  must be light off
        The canopy must be closed/locked  key (toggle) "d"

        -============On Any Carrier================-
        =Take Off
        -Maintain the "L" key depressed the time to activate the launbar (5 seconds)-
        -You can see that operation with the external view-
        -Don't forget to prepare your Aircraft
        with ==Start Routine== and with ==Take Off ==on Runway or Carrier==
        -Then depress the "C" key  to launch
        =Landing
        -Your approach  is about 130 Knts ( you can help yourself with the AoA indicator)
        -The Hook must be down key "O"
        -The Aircraft must be prepared with wings incidences UP and gears DOWN
        -The Hook will operate only if it is in touch on the deck close to the wires center area

        =============Consummables========================
        There is two kind of tanks, Main Tank and Transfer Tank
        The Main Tank is not full up.
        The engine will ONLY pump fuel from that Main Tank.
        If you get the alarm "LOW LEVEL", you can transfer fuel from the Transfer Tank,
        if there is any fuel in the Transfer Tank (look at the capacity tank instruments) you can transfer the fuel
        from Transfer Tank to Main Tank, click the "FUEL TRANSFER" switch  on the front Panel (top right)
        
        =============The Mule=============================
        You may want to experiment the Taxiing with Mule
        To do it:
        1/ You must have Cutoff to True =>   toggle key "{"   if you are Cutoff False
        2/ With "m" key  you will notice a mule in front of the Aircraft
        3/ Key "+" or "-" will operate the force of the Mula
        4/ The usual direction Key, Mouse, Joysyick,  will give the direction of the Mule
        
        =============The Automatic Taxiing======================
        Key"M" (upper case)  Taxi ON/OFF
        Or better on the menu: F-8E:
        1/ click on the catapult you want to go to 
        2/ then click on Go Taxi_to
        Remember the rules:
        1/ Nimitz Class has 4 catapults 1,2,3,4
        2/ Clemenceau Class has 2 catapults only 1,2
        3/ If you choose a catapult which don't exist the AC will go anywhere.
        4/ the Aircraft must be, at least parked behind the choosen Taxi_to catapult , NOT in front of.
